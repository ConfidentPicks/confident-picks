# Current System Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Currently Running (10 Python Processes)

The following monitoring and data collection scripts are now active:

### NBA Data Collection:
- **nba_data_fetcher.py** - Fetching historical NBA team data (2021-2024)
- **update_nba_current_teams.py** - Updating current 2025-26 season data

### NHL Model Training:
- **nhl_moneyline_exhaustive_test.py** - Training moneyline prediction models
- **nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py** - Training puck line prediction models

### NFL Model Training:
- **nfl_moneyline_exhaustive_test.py** - Training moneyline prediction models  
- **nfl_spread_exhaustive_test.py** - Training spread prediction models
- **nfl_total_exhaustive_test.py** - Training total (over/under) prediction models

## üìä How to Monitor Progress

### Check Running Processes:
```powershell
Get-Process python | Select-Object Id,@{Name='Command';Expression={(Get-WmiObject Win32_Process -Filter "ProcessId=$($_.Id)").CommandLine}}
```

### Check Progress Files:
- `confident-picks-automation/nhl_moneyline_progress.json`
- `confident-picks-automation/nhl_puckline_progress.json`
- `confident-picks-automation/nfl_moneyline_progress.json`
- `confident-picks-automation/nfl_spread_progress.json`
- `confident-picks-automation/nfl_total_progress.json`
- `confident-picks-automation/nba_fetch_progress.json`

### Check Google Sheets:
- **NBA Data:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hel-NsCxmk07nM0AH4VkJFB9hSK23X7XOxtA4wyRNRo
- Look for new data being added to the sheets

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Completion Times

- **NBA Historical Data:** 15-24 hours
- **Model Training:** Varies by model complexity (hours to days)

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Let scripts run** - All are working in the background
2. **Check progress periodically** - View progress JSON files
3. **Wait for completion** - Don't interrupt running processes
4. **Review results** - Check Firebase for new trained models
5. **Test models** - Once complete, review model performance

## üõ†Ô∏è If Issues Occur

To restart all scripts:
```batch
start_all_monitoring.bat
```

To stop all scripts:
```powershell
Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force
```

## üìã Summary

Your system is now collecting NBA data and training prediction models for NHL and NFL. Everything is running automatically in the background.

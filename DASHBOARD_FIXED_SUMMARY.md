# ✅ Dashboard Fixed - Summary

## 🎉 **COMPLETED!**

The dashboard has been completely overhauled to show **REAL DATA ONLY**.

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **Removed ALL Mock Data** ❌→✅
- **Before**: Dashboard showed fake teams (SEA, VAN, SJS) with random accuracy (80.9%)
- **After**: Shows "No models found" until real models are saved to Firebase
- **Deleted**: `generateMockData()`, `generateMockNHLData()`, `generateMockNFLData()` functions

### 2. **Added Real-Time Training Progress** 🔄
- **New Section**: "Active Training Sessions" card
- **Shows**:
  - NHL Moneyline: X/32 teams (with progress bar)
  - NHL Puck Line: X/32 teams (with progress bar)
  - NFL Spread: Not started yet
  - NFL Total: Not started yet
- **Updates**: Reads from JSON files every 10 seconds
- **Visual**: Color-coded progress bars (blue=running, green=complete, gray=pending)

### 3. **Auto-Refresh Every 10 Seconds** ⏱️
- Dashboard automatically reloads data
- No manual refresh needed
- Console logs: "🔄 Auto-refreshing dashboard..."

---

## 📊 **How It Works Now:**

### Data Sources:
1. **Firebase `approved_models` collection** - For completed models
2. **JSON Progress Files** - For training status:
   - `nhl_model_test_progress.json` (Moneyline)
   - `nhl_puckline_progress.json` (Puck Line)
   - `nfl_spread_progress.json` (Spread)
   - `nfl_total_progress.json` (Total)

### What You'll See:
- **If no models yet**: "No models found" message
- **Training Progress**: Real-time updates showing X/32 teams completed
- **Progress Bars**: Visual indication of completion percentage
- **Status Indicators**:
  - 🔄 Running (blue)
  - ✅ Complete (green)
  - ⏸️ Not started (gray)

---

## 🔄 **Current Training Status:**

| Script | Status | Progress File | Teams Found |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| NHL Moneyline | 🟢 RUNNING | `nhl_model_test_progress.json` | 8/32 |
| NHL Puck Line | 🟢 RUNNING | `nhl_puckline_progress.json` | 6/32 |
| NFL Spread | 🔴 NOT CREATED | - | 0/32 |
| NFL Total | 🔴 NOT CREATED | - | 0/32 |

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

### 1. **Refresh Dashboard** (Do this now!)
- Close and reopen `model_performance_dashboard.html`
- You should see:
  - "Active Training Sessions" section
  - NHL Moneyline: 8/32 teams
  - NHL Puck Line: 6/32 teams
  - NFL Spread/Total: Not started

### 2. **Verify Auto-Refresh**
- Watch the progress bars update every 10 seconds
- Check browser console for "🔄 Auto-refreshing dashboard..."

### 3. **Create NFL Scripts** (Next task - 5-10 minutes)
- NFL Spread exhaustive test
- NFL Total exhaustive test

   - Removed mock data functions (lines 415-478)
   - Added `loadTrainingProgress()` function

## ✅ **Success Criteria:**

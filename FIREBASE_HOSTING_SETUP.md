# ðŸš€ Firebase Hosting Setup Guide

## Step 1: Login to Firebase (MANUAL STEP)

**Open a NEW PowerShell window** (not in this chat) and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\durel\Documents\confident-picks-restored
firebase login
```

This will:
1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to sign in with Google
3. Grant Firebase CLI access

**After you log in successfully, come back here and let me know!**

---

## Step 2: Initialize Firebase Hosting (I'll do this after you log in)

Once you're logged in, I'll run:
```powershell
firebase init hosting
```

This will:
- Connect to your Firebase project
- Set up hosting configuration
- Create `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`

---

## Step 3: Prepare Files for Deployment

I'll create a `public` folder with:
- `index.html` (your main app)
- `logo.png` (your logo)
- Any other assets

---

## Step 4: Deploy to Firebase

```powershell
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This uploads your site to Firebase servers.

---

## Step 5: Connect Your Domain

In Firebase Console:
1. Go to Hosting section
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter: `confident-picks.com`
4. Follow DNS instructions

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **YOUR ACTION NOW:**

**Open a NEW PowerShell window and run:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\durel\Documents\confident-picks-restored
firebase login
```

**Then tell me when you're logged in!** âœ…

## Alternative: Use Firebase Console (No CLI needed)

If you prefer, we can deploy directly from the Firebase Console:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project: "Confident-Picks-App"
3. Click "Hosting" in left menu
4. Click "Get started"
5. Upload your files manually

**Which method do you prefer?**
- **A)** CLI (need to login first)
- **B)** Console (manual upload)

Let me know!

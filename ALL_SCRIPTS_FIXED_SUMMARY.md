## 📊 **Can Your System Handle This?**

### **YES! Here's why:**

**Your System Can Handle 10+ Scripts Easily:**
1. **I/O-Bound, Not CPU-Bound**
   - Scripts spend 90% of time waiting for:
     - API responses (ESPN, Google Sheets)
     - Network requests
     - File I/O operations
   - Only 10% actual CPU computation

2. **Built-in Rate Limiting**
   - Each script sleeps between requests
   - NBA: 0.5 seconds between API calls
   - NFL: Processes in batches with pauses
   - NHL: Similar rate limiting

3. **Efficient Resource Usage**
   - Each Python process: ~50-100 MB RAM
   - 5 scripts = ~250-500 MB total
   - Modern PCs have 8-32 GB RAM
   - **You're using < 2% of available RAM**

4. **Windows Task Scheduler**
   - Designed to handle dozens of background tasks
   - Each PowerShell window is independent
   - Minimized windows use minimal resources

**Bottom Line:** You could run 20+ scripts without issues!

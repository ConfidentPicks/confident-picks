# ✅ Google Authentication Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Firebase SDK Compatibility Issue**
- **Problem:** App was using modern Firebase SDK v10 (ES6 modules), but Google Sign-In code was trying to use legacy SDK (`firebase.auth()`)
- **Solution:** Updated Google Sign-In to use modern SDK with `import` and `signInWithPopup`

### 2. **Domain Authorization**
- **Problem:** `confident-picks.com` was not authorized for OAuth operations in Firebase
- **Solution:** Added domain to Firebase Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains

### 3. **Google Sign-In Provider Not Enabled**
- **Problem:** Google was not enabled as a sign-in provider in Firebase
- **Solution:** Enabled Google provider in Firebase Authentication → Sign-in method

### 4. **Mock Authentication Interference**
- **Problem:** Old mock Google auth code was running before real Firebase code, showing "Signed in with Google! (mock)" message
- **Solution:** Removed old mock code (lines 3441-3448)

### 5. **Search Input Autofill**
- **Problem:** User's email was appearing in the search/filter input due to browser autofill
- **Solution:** Added `autocomplete="off"` and JavaScript to clear input on page load

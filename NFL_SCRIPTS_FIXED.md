# ✅ NFL Scripts Fixed!

## 🔍 **Problem Found**

All 3 NFL scripts were failing with `KeyError: 'date'` because:
- Scripts were looking for a column called `date`
- The actual column in the sheet is called `gameday`

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

Updated all 3 NFL scripts:
1. **`nfl_spread_exhaustive_test.py`**
2. **`nfl_total_exhaustive_test.py`**
3. **`nfl_moneyline_exhaustive_test.py`**

### Changes Made:
```python
# OLD (broken):
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce')

# NEW (fixed):
if 'gameday' in df.columns:
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['gameday'], errors='coerce')
else:
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime('today')
```

Also added proper column names for numeric conversion:
- Spread: `spread_line`
- Total: `total_line`
- Moneyline: `away_moneyline`, `home_moneyline`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### 1. 🏷️ Create Live Mode Price in Stripe

**Current Issue:** The `priceId` in the code is still set to a test mode price:
```javascript
priceId: 'price_1SF51I1G2mT1SwALThzOjtiQ'
```

**You MUST do this:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Make sure you're in **LIVE MODE** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **"+ Add product"**
4. Set up your subscription:
   - **Name:** Confident Picks Premium
   - **Description:** Unlimited access to all premium picks
   - **Price:** $15.00 USD
   - **Billing period:** Monthly
   - **Recurring:** Yes
5. Click **"Save product"**
6. Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_...`)
7. **Update `index.html` line 7332** with the new live price ID
8. Commit and push the change

---

### 2. 🔔 Set Up Stripe Webhooks

Webhooks are **CRITICAL** for handling successful payments and activating subscriptions.

#### Step 1: Create Webhook Endpoint

You need a backend endpoint to receive Stripe events. Options:

**Option A: Firebase Cloud Function (Recommended)**
```javascript
// functions/index.js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const stripe = require('stripe')(functions.config().stripe.secret);

exports.stripeWebhook = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
  const webhookSecret = functions.config().stripe.webhook_secret;
  
  let event;
  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.rawBody, sig, webhookSecret);
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
  }
  
  // Handle the event
  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object;
    const userId = session.client_reference_id;
    
    // Update user subscription in Firestore
    await admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).update({
      subscription: {
        status: 'active',
        tier: 'premium',
        stripeCustomerId: session.customer,
        stripePriceId: session.line_items?.data[0]?.price?.id,
        startedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        currentPeriodEnd: new Date(session.subscription?.current_period_end * 1000).toISOString()
      }
    });
  }
  
  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

**Option B: Netlify/Vercel Function**
- Similar implementation, adapted for your hosting platform

#### Step 2: Register Webhook in Stripe

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **"+ Add endpoint"**
3. **Endpoint URL:** `https://confident-picks.com/api/stripe-webhook`
   - (Or your Firebase Function URL)
4. **Events to send:**
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)
7. Store this secret securely in your backend environment

---

### 3. 🧪 Test the Payment Flow

**Before going live with real customers:**

1. **Use Stripe Test Cards:**
   - Go to: https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry date
   - Any 3-digit CVC

2. **Test the full flow:**
   - Sign up for a free account on confident-picks.com
   - Click "Upgrade" button
   - Complete checkout with test card
   - Verify webhook receives the event
   - Verify user subscription is activated in Firestore
   - Verify user sees premium picks

3. **Test cancellation:**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard > Customers
   - Cancel a test subscription
   - Verify webhook handles `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Verify user is downgraded to free tier

---

## 📊 Current Payment Flow

### User Journey:
1. User clicks "Upgrade" button
2. Frontend calls `redirectToCheckout()` with live price ID
3. User is redirected to Stripe's secure checkout page
4. User enters payment details and completes purchase
5. Stripe processes payment
6. Stripe redirects user back to: `https://confident-picks.com/?session_id=...&success=true`
7. Stripe sends webhook event to your backend
8. Backend updates Firestore with subscription status
9. User sees premium picks on next page load

### What's Missing:
- ❌ Backend webhook endpoint (Step 2 above)
- ❌ Success page handler (to show confirmation message)
- ❌ Subscription status sync from Stripe to Firestore

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Secure:
- Publishable key is safe to expose in frontend
- Actual payment processing happens on Stripe's servers
- No credit card data touches your servers

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention:
- **Secret key** (`sk_live_...`) should NEVER be in frontend code
- Store it in backend environment variables only
- Webhook endpoint must verify signature to prevent spoofing
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints

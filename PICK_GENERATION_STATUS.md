# Pick Generation Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Old picks cleared:** Successfully deleted 153 old/incorrect picks from Firebase
2. **Pick generation script fixed:** All Firebase API errors resolved
3. **101 approved models in Firebase:** Mostly NHL models that have reached 70%+
4. **163 upcoming NFL games found:** Games without scores ready for predictions

---

## ‚ùå Why No Picks Are Being Generated

**All NFL models have 0% accuracy** - they're still training!

### Model Status:
- **NFL models:** 44 models in Firebase, but all show 0% accuracy (still training)
  - CHI Moneyline: 0%
  - MIA Moneyline: 0%
  - SF Moneyline: 0%
  - ATL Total: 0%
  - BAL Total: 0%
  - etc.

- **NHL models:** 57 models with 70%+ accuracy (ready to generate picks)
  - But no NHL upcoming games tab set up yet

---

## üîÑ What's Currently Running

Check your training windows:
1. **NHL Puck Line** - Already found 6 teams @ 70%+
2. **NFL Spread** - Training in progress
3. **NFL Total** - Training in progress  
4. **NFL Moneyline** - Training in progress

## üìä Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for NFL Models to Finish Training
- Let the 3 NFL training scripts run overnight
- Once models reach 70%+, they'll be saved to Firebase
- Then run `python generate_picks_from_models.py` again
- Picks will be generated automatically

### Option 2: Set Up NHL Pick Generation Now
- NHL models are ready (57 models @ 70%+)
- Need to create "Upcoming Games" tab in NHL sheet
- Or fetch upcoming NHL games from Odds API
- Then enable NHL in the pick generator

### Option 3: Lower the Confidence Threshold (Not Recommended)
- Change the 70% threshold to 60% in `generate_picks_from_models.py`
- This would generate picks from untrained/low-accuracy models
- **NOT RECOMMENDED** - defeats the purpose of quality control

## üéØ Recommended Action

**Wait for NFL models to finish training** (overnight), then:

1. Check training progress tomorrow:
```bash
check_training_status.bat
```

2. Check model performance dashboard:
```
Open: model_performance_dashboard.html
```

3. Once you see NFL models @ 70%+, generate picks:
```bash
python generate_picks_from_models.py
```

4. Check your app - picks will appear automatically!

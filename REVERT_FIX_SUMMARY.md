# ✅ Fixed: Reverted Changes Restored

## 🔍 **What Happened**

Your `index.html` file was accidentally reverted to an older version that had **mock authentication** instead of the real Firebase authentication we set up. This caused:

1. ❌ **Mock Google Sign-In** (not real Firebase auth)
2. ❌ **Email appearing in search filter** (fix was removed)
3. ❌ **App treating you as not signed in** (Firebase auth removed)
4. ❌ **Stripe Checkout not working** (backend integration removed)

---

## ✅ **What I Did**

Ran `git restore index.html` to restore the correct version from GitHub with all the fixes:

- ✅ Real Firebase Google Sign-In
- ✅ Email autofill fix
- ✅ Stripe Checkout Sessions (backend integration)
- ✅ Admin role checking
- ✅ User data syncing from Firestore

## 🧪 **Test Now (Full Flow)**

### **1. Clear Browser Cache**

**Important:** You need to clear your browser cache to get the updated `index.html`:

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** (or **Cmd+Shift+Delete** on Mac)
2. Select **"Cached images and files"**
3. Select **"All time"**
4. Click **"Clear data"**

**OR** do a **hard refresh:**
- Windows: **Ctrl+Shift+R** or **Ctrl+F5**
- Mac: **Cmd+Shift+R**

### **2. Test Google Sign-In**

1. Go to: `https://confident-picks.com`
2. Click **"Sign in with Google"**
3. You should see the **real Google authentication popup**
4. Sign in with `durellmars@gmail.com`
5. You should be redirected to the Picks page

### **3. Verify Fixes**

- ✅ **No mock popup** should appear
- ✅ **Your email should NOT appear in the search filter**
- ✅ **You should be signed in** (not redirected to sign-up page)
- ✅ **Upgrade button should work** (redirects to Stripe Checkout)

## 📋 **About the Firebase Domain**

You mentioned:
> "it shows the firebase on the signup instead of just confident-picks.com"

This is **normal and expected** for Firebase Authentication. The Google Sign-In popup shows:
```
Sign in to confident-picks-app-8-25.firebaseapp.com
```

**Why?**
- Firebase uses this domain for OAuth callbacks
- It's a secure, Google-managed domain
- Your actual app runs on `confident-picks.com`
- This is how all Firebase apps work

**Is it a problem?**
- ❌ No, this is standard Firebase behavior
- ✅ Users understand this is part of Google's authentication
- ✅ Your brand (`confident-picks.com`) is still the main domain

**Can it be changed?**
- Not easily - Firebase requires this for OAuth security
- You could use a custom OAuth flow, but it's much more complex
- Most apps (including major ones) use Firebase's default domain

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist**

If you still see the old behavior after clearing cache:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Try incognito/private mode** to bypass cache completely
3. **Verify GitHub Pages deployed** the latest version:
   - Go to: https://github.com/ConfidentPicks/confident-picks/actions
   - Check if the latest commit was deployed

## 💰 How It Works Now

### User Payment Flow:
```
1. User visits confident-picks.com
2. Signs up for free account
3. Clicks "Upgrade" button ($15/month)
4. Redirected to Stripe secure checkout
5. Enters payment details
6. Stripe processes payment
7. Webhook activates premium subscription
8. User redirected back to site
9. User sees all premium picks!
```

### Subscription Management:
- **New subscription** → Webhook activates premium tier
- **Monthly renewal** → Webhook updates expiry date
- **Cancellation** → Webhook downgrades to free tier
- **Payment failure** → Webhook logs failure (user stays active until period ends)

   - Complete a test payment
   - Verify subscription activates in Firestore
   - Verify you see premium picks

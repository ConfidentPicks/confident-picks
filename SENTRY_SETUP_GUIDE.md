# 📊 Sentry Error Monitoring Setup Guide

## What is Sentry?

Sentry automatically catches all JavaScript errors in your production app and sends you alerts. You'll know about bugs before users report them!

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Catch errors in real-time
- ✅ See stack traces and user context
- ✅ Get email/Slack alerts
- ✅ Track error frequency
- ✅ See which users are affected
- ✅ **FREE** for 50,000 errors/month

## Step 1: Create Sentry Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://sentry.io/signup/
2. Sign up with email (or GitHub/Google)
3. Choose **Free Plan**
4. Verify your email

---

## Step 2: Create Project (2 minutes)

1. Click **Create Project**
2. Select **JavaScript** as platform
3. Project name: `confident-picks`
4. Click **Create Project**

---

## Step 3: Get Your DSN (1 minute)

After creating the project, you'll see:

```
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://abc123def456@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/7890123",
  ...
});
```

**Copy the DSN** (the long URL starting with `https://`)

---

## Step 4: Integration (I'll do this)

Once you share the DSN with me, I'll:
1. Add Sentry SDK to `index.html`
2. Configure error tracking
3. Set up user context
4. Add breadcrumbs for debugging
5. Filter sensitive data

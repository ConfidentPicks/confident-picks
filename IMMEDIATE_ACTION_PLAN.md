## üî• **CRITICAL PATH TASKS (Must Do Before Launch)**

These tasks **block the launch** and should be prioritized:

### **1. Firebase Security Rules (2 hours) üî¥**
**Why Critical:** Currently anyone can modify user roles and subscription status  
**Risk:** Users could give themselves admin access or premium subscriptions  
**Action:**
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read their own data
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can update their own data EXCEPT role and subscription
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.uid == userId
                    && !request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasAny(['role', 'subscription']);
      
      // Only admins can write role and subscription
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Approved models - read-only for everyone, write for admins
    match /approved_models/{modelId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Picks collections - read for authenticated, write for admins
    match /{collection}/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
2. Paste the rules above
3. Click "Publish"
4. Test by trying to modify your role as a non-admin user

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Can Start:** NOW (doesn't depend on anything)

---

### **2. Domain Purchase & Setup (1 hour) üî¥**
**Why Critical:** Need domain for email, hosting, and production URL  
**Action:**
1. Purchase domain (e.g., `confidentpicks.com`, `confident-picks.com`)
   - Recommended: Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare
   - Cost: ~$12/year
2. Set up DNS records (will configure later when hosting is ready)

**Time:** 15 minutes to purchase  
**Can Start:** NOW

---

### **3. Stripe Live Mode (1 hour) üî¥**
**Why Critical:** Can't accept real payments in sandbox mode  
**Action:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API Keys
2. Copy **Live** publishable key (starts with `pk_live_`)
3. Copy **Live** secret key (starts with `sk_live_`)
4. Update `index.html`:
```javascript
const stripeConfig = {
    publishableKey: 'pk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE',  // Change from pk_test_
    priceId: 'price_YOUR_LIVE_PRICE_ID',      // Create in Stripe Dashboard
    mode: 'production'  // Change from 'sandbox'
};
```
5. Remove "(Sandbox)" labels from upgrade buttons
6. Test with real card

**Time:** 1 hour  
**Can Start:** NOW (if Stripe account is approved)

---

### **4. Stripe Webhooks (6 hours) üî¥**
**Why Critical:** Need to automatically activate subscriptions when users pay  
**Action:** Create Firebase Cloud Function to handle Stripe webhooks

**I can create this for you right now!**

---

### **5. Production Hosting (2 hours) üî¥**
**Why Critical:** Need to deploy the app to a public URL  
**Options:**
- **Firebase Hosting** (Recommended - already using Firebase)
- **Netlify** (Easy, free tier)
- **Vercel** (Easy, free tier)

**Action:**
```bash
# If using Firebase Hosting:
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

**Time:** 2 hours  
**Depends On:** Domain purchase (Task 2)

---

### **6. Email System (4 hours) üî¥**
**Why Critical:** Need real email for verification, password reset, receipts  
**Options:**
- **SendGrid** (12,000 free emails/month)
- **AWS SES** (62,000 free emails/month)
- **Mailgun** (5,000 free emails/month)

**Recommendation:** Start with SendGrid (easiest setup)

**I can create the email service integration for you!**

---

## ‚ö° **PARALLEL TASKS (Do While Models Train)**

These can be done simultaneously:

### **A. Terms of Service & Privacy Policy (4 hours) üî¥**
**Action:** Use AI to generate, then review
```
I can generate these for you using Claude/ChatGPT with your specific details!
```

### **B. Error Monitoring Setup (2 hours) üî¥**
**Options:**
- **Sentry** (Free tier: 5K events/month)
- **LogRocket** (Free tier: 1K sessions/month)

**Recommendation:** Sentry (better for errors)

### **C. Automated Backups (3 hours) üî¥**
**Action:** Set up daily Firestore exports
```javascript
// Firebase Cloud Function (I can create this)
exports.scheduledFirestoreExport = functions.pubsub
    .schedule('every 24 hours')
    .onRun(async (context) => {
        // Export Firestore to Google Cloud Storage
    });
```

## üèÄ **LEAGUE EXPANSION (Background Work)**

While models train, we can start on new leagues:

### **Priority Order:**
1. ‚úÖ **NHL** - In progress (17/32 teams for Puck Line!)
2. ‚úÖ **NFL** - In progress (just started)
3. üîÑ **NBA** - Start data collection NOW (season is active!)
4. üîÑ **NCAAF** - Start data collection (season is active!)
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **NCAAB** - Wait (season starts November)
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è **UFC** - Lower priority

**Recommendation:** Start NBA and NCAAF data collection in parallel

## üéØ **WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW**

Pick ONE of these to start immediately:

### **Option A: Security First (Safest)**
1. Deploy Firebase Security Rules (30 min)
2. Test that users can't modify their own roles
3. Then start NBA data collection

### **Option B: Revenue First (Fastest to monetization)**
1. Purchase domain (15 min)
2. Set up Stripe live mode (1 hour)
3. Create webhook handler (3 hours)
4. Start accepting real payments

### **Option C: Content First (More picks faster)**
1. Start NBA data collection (2 hours setup, runs overnight)
2. Start NCAAF data collection (2 hours setup, runs overnight)
3. While those run, work on security rules

---

## üí° **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**Do this order:**
1. **Firebase Security Rules** (30 min) - Critical security fix
2. **Purchase Domain** (15 min) - Needed for everything else
3. **Start NBA Data Collection** (2 hours) - Runs in background overnight
4. **Generate Legal Docs** (1 hour with AI) - Required for launch

**Total Active Time:** ~4 hours  
**Result:** Security fixed, domain purchased, NBA data collecting, legal docs ready

Then tomorrow tackle Stripe and hosting.

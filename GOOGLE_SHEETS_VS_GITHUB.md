## 🎯 My Recommendation

**For your use case, I recommend Google Sheets because:**

1. **You already have a sheet** - No need to start over
2. **Visual editing** - You can see and edit picks easily
3. **Quick setup** - Just 3 steps to get working
4. **Familiar interface** - Most people know Google Sheets
5. **Real-time collaboration** - Team can edit together

**But consider GitHub if:**
- You want automatic backups
- You need version history
- You plan to build more integrations
- You want unlimited storage

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

You can actually use **both**! Here's how:

1. **Primary:** Google Sheets for daily editing and analysis
2. **Backup:** GitHub for version control and backup
3. **Sync:** Automatically sync Google Sheets → GitHub daily

This gives you:
- ✅ Visual editing in Google Sheets
- ✅ Version history in GitHub
- ✅ Automatic backups
- ✅ Team collaboration
- ✅ Unlimited storage

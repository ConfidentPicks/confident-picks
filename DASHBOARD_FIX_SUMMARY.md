# üéØ Dashboard Mock Data Fix - Summary

## ‚úÖ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The dashboard was showing **mock data** in the table even though the training scripts were running and finding real models.

### **Root Causes:**

1. **Wrong Firebase Collection**
   - Dashboard was reading from: `model_performance`
   - Scripts were writing to: `approved_models`
   - Result: Dashboard showed cached/mock data

2. **Scripts Weren't Saving to Firebase**
   - `nhl_exhaustive_test.py` and `nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py` only saved progress to JSON files
   - They never saved actual model data to Firebase
   - Result: Even if dashboard looked at the right collection, it would be empty

3. **Browser Cache**
   - Old mock data was cached in the browser
   - Needed hard refresh to see changes

## üõ†Ô∏è **FIXES APPLIED**

### **Fix 1: Updated Exhaustive Testing Scripts**

**Files Modified:**
- `confident-picks-automation/nhl_exhaustive_test.py`
- `confident-picks-automation/nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py`

**Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Added Firebase Admin SDK imports
2. ‚úÖ Created `save_model_to_firebase()` function
3. ‚úÖ When a team reaches 70%+ accuracy, it now saves to Firebase `approved_models` collection
4. ‚úÖ Stores: sport, team, prop, modelName, historicalAccuracy, currentAccuracy, status, config, timestamps

**Example Firebase Document:**
```json
{
  "sport": "NHL",
  "team": "TOR",
  "prop": "Puck Line",
  "modelName": "NHL-PL-v100-0.05",
  "historicalAccuracy": 74.2,
  "currentAccuracy": 74.2,
  "status": "approved",
  "config": "(100, 0.05, 0, 2)",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-25T20:45:00",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-25T20:45:00"
}
```

### **Fix 2: Updated Dashboard to Read Correct Collection**

**File Modified:**
- `model_performance_dashboard.html`

**Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Changed Firebase collection from `model_performance` to `approved_models` (line 397)
2. ‚úÖ Added "Clear Cache & Refresh" button to force browser to reload
3. ‚úÖ Added `clearCacheAndRefresh()` function to clear localStorage, sessionStorage, and force reload

---

### **Fix 3: Restarted Training Scripts**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ‚úÖ Restarted `nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py` with new Firebase saving code
2. ‚úÖ Restarted `nhl_exhaustive_test.py` with new Firebase saving code
3. ‚úÖ Started `monitor_firebase_models.py` to watch models being saved in real-time

---

## üìä **HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING**

### **Step 1: Check Firebase Monitor**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python confident-picks-automation\monitor_firebase_models.py
```

You should see models being added as the scripts find 70%+ teams:
```
================================================================================
FIREBASE MODELS: 17 total
================================================================================

NHL - Puck Line: 17 teams
  ‚Ä¢ TOR   - Historical: 74.2% | Current: 74.2% | approved
  ‚Ä¢ BOS   - Historical: 72.8% | Current: 72.8% | approved
  ‚Ä¢ ...
```

---

### **Step 2: Refresh Dashboard**
1. Open dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/model_performance_dashboard.html`
2. Click **"üîÑ Clear Cache & Refresh"** button
3. You should now see:
   - ‚úÖ **Real progress bars** (NHL Moneyline: 12/32, NHL Puck Line: 17/32)
   - ‚úÖ **Real model data in table** (actual team names, real accuracy percentages, unique model names)
   - ‚ùå **No more mock data** (no more "SEA", "VAN", "SJS" with fake "NHL-ML-v1.0-AB")

---

### **Step 3: Watch Real-Time Updates**
The dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds. As the scripts find more 70%+ teams, you'll see:
- Progress bars increase (e.g., 17/32 ‚Üí 18/32 ‚Üí 19/32)
- New rows appear in the table
- "TEAMS @ 70%+" counter increases

---

## üöÄ **WHAT'S RUNNING NOW**

### **Active Background Processes:**

1. **NHL Moneyline Training**
   - Script: `nhl_exhaustive_test.py`
   - Status: Running (currently 12/32 teams at 70%+)
   - Saves to: Firebase `approved_models` collection

2. **NHL Puck Line Training**
   - Script: `nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py`
   - Status: Running (currently 17/32 teams at 70%+)
   - Saves to: Firebase `approved_models` collection

3. **Firebase Monitor**
   - Script: `monitor_firebase_models.py`
   - Status: Running (updates every 5 seconds)
   - Shows: Real-time model count and details

4. **Local Web Server**
   - Command: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Status: Running on port 8000
   - Purpose: Serve dashboard and allow JSON file access

---

## üìù **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate:**
1. ‚úÖ Wait for NHL Moneyline to reach 15+ teams at 70%+
2. ‚úÖ Wait for NHL Puck Line to reach 32 teams at 70%+
3. ‚úÖ Verify dashboard shows real data (no mock data)

### **Soon:**
1. Create NFL Spread exhaustive testing script
2. Create NFL Total exhaustive testing script
3. Start NBA, NCAAF, NCAAB, UFC data collection

---

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If dashboard still shows mock data:**
1. Click "üîÑ Clear Cache & Refresh" button
2. Or press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Or open in incognito/private browsing mode

### **If progress bars say "Not started yet":**
1. Make sure local web server is running: `python -m http.server 8000`
2. Access dashboard via `http://localhost:8000/model_performance_dashboard.html` (not `file://`)
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### **If table is empty:**
1. Check Firebase monitor: `python confident-picks-automation\monitor_firebase_models.py`
2. If Firebase is empty, wait for scripts to find 70%+ teams
3. Check that training scripts are still running (look for PowerShell windows)

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows **real team names** (not just SEA, VAN, SJS)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows **unique model names** (not all "NHL-ML-v1.0-AB")
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows **varying accuracy percentages** (not all 84%, 82%, 74%)
- ‚úÖ Progress bars show **real progress** (12/32, 17/32, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Firebase monitor shows **increasing model count**
- ‚úÖ Table updates **automatically every 10 seconds**

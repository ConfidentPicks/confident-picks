## üîß **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **NFL Total - Data Leakage Fixed**

**Problem:**
- Script was comparing against `df['total']` (actual final score)
- Should compare against `df['total_line']` (betting line)
- This caused 100% accuracy on all teams (impossible!)

**Fix:**
```python
# OLD (broken):
df['is_over'] = ((df['away_score'] + df['home_score']) > df['total']).astype(int)

# NEW (fixed):
df['is_over'] = ((df['away_score'] + df['home_score']) > df['total_line']).astype(int)
```

Also fixed the feature calculation to use `total_line` instead of `total`.

**Expected Result:**
- Realistic accuracies (60-80% range)
- No more 100% perfect predictions

---

### 2. **NFL Spread - Column Name Fixed**

**Problem:**
- Script was looking for `date` column
- Actual column is `gameday`

**Fix:**
```python
# Use 'gameday' column (not 'date')
if 'gameday' in df.columns:
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['gameday'], errors='coerce')
```

---

### 3. **NFL Moneyline - Column Name Fixed**

Same fix as Spread - using `gameday` instead of `date`.

## üöÄ **Restart All Training**

### **Option 1: Use New Batch File (Recommended)**

Double-click: `RESTART_ALL_TRAINING.bat`

This will:
1. Kill all old Python processes
2. Start 5 training scripts:
   - NHL Moneyline
   - NHL Puck Line
   - NFL Spread
   - NFL Total (with data leakage fix!)
   - NFL Moneyline

### **Option 2: Manual Restart**

```powershell
# Kill old processes
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

# Start each script in a separate window
cd confident-picks-automation
start cmd /k "python nhl_exhaustive_test.py"
start cmd /k "python nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py"

cd ..
start cmd /k "python nfl_spread_exhaustive_test.py"
start cmd /k "python nfl_total_exhaustive_test.py"
start cmd /k "python nfl_moneyline_exhaustive_test.py"
```

## üìà **Expected Results After Restart**

### **NFL Moneyline** (Already working)
- Teams: GB (91.7%), DEN (72.7%), MIA (70.0%), CIN (90.9%), LAR (90.0%), CHI (70.0%)
- ‚úÖ Realistic accuracies

### **NFL Total** (After fix)
- **Before:** All teams 100% (data leakage)
- **After:** Realistic 60-80% range
- Will take time to find good models

### **NFL Spread** (After fix)
- Should start training without errors
- Will find teams with 70%+ accuracy

## üèÄ **About NBA**

NBA data collection is still in progress. Once the `nba_data_fetcher.py` completes:
1. Historical data will be in the NBA Google Sheet
2. We'll create NBA training scripts
3. Start NBA model training

**Current Status:** Data collection in progress (check `nba_fetch_progress.json`)

---

## üìä **Monitor Progress**

1. **Dashboard:** Open `model_performance_dashboard.html` in browser
2. **Progress Files:**
   - `nhl_model_test_progress.json` - NHL Moneyline
   - `nhl_puckline_progress.json` - NHL Puck Line
   - `nfl_moneyline_progress.json` - NFL Moneyline
   - `nfl_total_progress.json` - NFL Total
   - (NFL Spread will create its own)

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

- ‚úÖ **NFL Total data leakage FIXED** - Will now show realistic accuracies
- ‚úÖ **NFL Spread column error FIXED** - Will run without crashes
- ‚úÖ **NFL Moneyline working correctly** - Already finding good models
- ‚úÖ **NHL scripts running** - 12+ teams @ 70%+ already!
- ‚è≥ **NBA pending** - Data collection in progress

# 🔧 Model Training Status - Quick Fix

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Restored Dashboard**
- ✅ Restored `model_performance_dashboard.html` (was accidentally deleted)
- You can now view it at: `file:///C:/Users/durel/Documents/confident-picks-restored/model_performance_dashboard.html`

### 2. **Created Restart Script**
- ✅ Created `check_training_status.bat` to restart all NFL training scripts

## 🚀 **How to Restart Training Scripts**

### **Option 1: Use the Batch File (Recommended)**

Double-click: `check_training_status.bat`

This will:
- Show current Python processes
- Restart NFL Spread, Total, and Moneyline training scripts
- Open each in a separate window so you can monitor them

### **Option 2: Manual Restart**

Open 3 separate PowerShell windows and run:

```powershell
# Window 1: NFL Spread
cd confident-picks-automation
python nfl_spread_exhaustive_test.py

# Window 2: NFL Total
cd confident-picks-automation
python nfl_total_exhaustive_test.py

# Window 3: NFL Moneyline
cd confident-picks-automation
python nfl_moneyline_exhaustive_test.py
```

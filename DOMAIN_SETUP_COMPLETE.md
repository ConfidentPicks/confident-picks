## 📊 **What's Next:**

Since your domain is already live, let's move to the next production task:

### **Option 1: Legal Documents** (1 hour)
- Generate Terms of Service
- Generate Privacy Policy
- Add to website footer
- Required before accepting real payments

### **Option 2: Stripe Live Mode** (1.5 hours)
- Switch from sandbox to production
- Start accepting real payments
- Set up webhooks

### **Option 3: Continue Building** (Ongoing)
- Let model training continue (currently running)
- Check progress in the morning
- Start NBA model training when data collection completes

---

## 🚀 **Recommendation:**

**Do Legal Documents next** because:
1. Quick (1 hour)
2. Required for launch
3. Can be done while models train
4. Needed before switching Stripe to live mode

**Then tomorrow:**
- Switch Stripe to live mode
- Review model training results
- Start NBA model training
- Plan soft launch

---

## 📈 **Current Background Progress:**

While we work on legal docs, these are running:
- 🏀 NBA Data: ~50% complete

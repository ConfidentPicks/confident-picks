# üîê Deploy Firebase Security Rules

## ‚úÖ **What These Rules Do**

### **Users Collection:**
- ‚úÖ Users can read their own data
- ‚úÖ Users can create their own profile on signup
- ‚úÖ Users can update their own data (favorites, settings, etc.)

- ‚úÖ Only admins can modify `role` and `subscription` fields

### **Approved Models Collection:**
- ‚úÖ Anyone can read models (needed for pick generation)
- ‚ùå Only admins can write/update models

## üìã **Deployment Steps**

### **Option 1: Firebase Console (Easiest)**

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project: `confident-picks-app-8-25`

2. **Navigate to Firestore Rules:**
   - Click "Firestore Database" in left sidebar
   - Click "Rules" tab at the top

3. **Copy the Rules:**
   - Open the file: `firestore.rules` (I just created it)
   - Copy ALL the contents

4. **Paste & Publish:**
   - Paste into the Firebase Console editor
   - Click "Publish" button
   - Wait for confirmation message

5. **Done!** ‚úÖ

---

### **Option 2: Firebase CLI (Advanced)**

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
# Deploy rules from command line
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## üß™ **Testing the Rules**

### **Test 1: Try to Modify Your Own Role (Should Fail)**

1. Open browser console (F12) on your app
2. Run this code:
```javascript
// Try to give yourself admin role (should fail)
const { doc, updateDoc } = await import('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js');
const userRef = doc(window.db, 'users', window.auth.currentUser.uid);
await updateDoc(userRef, { role: 'admin' });
```

**Expected Result:** Error message: `"Missing or insufficient permissions"`

---

### **Test 2: Try to Modify Your Own Subscription (Should Fail)**

```javascript
// Try to give yourself premium subscription (should fail)
const { doc, updateDoc } = await import('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js');
const userRef = doc(window.db, 'users', window.auth.currentUser.uid);
await updateDoc(userRef, { 
  subscription: { 
    status: 'active', 
    tier: 'premium' 
  } 
});
```

**Expected Result:** Error message: `"Missing or insufficient permissions"`

---

### **Test 3: Update Allowed Fields (Should Work)**

```javascript
// Update your display name (should work)
const { doc, updateDoc } = await import('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js');
const userRef = doc(window.db, 'users', window.auth.currentUser.uid);
await updateDoc(userRef, { 
  settings: { theme: 'dark' } 
});
```

**Expected Result:** Success! No error.

---

### **Test 4: Admin Can Modify Roles (Should Work if you're admin)**

```javascript
// As admin, give someone else admin role (should work)
const { doc, updateDoc } = await import('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.0.0/firebase-firestore.js');
const userRef = doc(window.db, 'users', 'SOME_OTHER_USER_ID');
await updateDoc(userRef, { role: 'admin' });
```

**Expected Result:** Success if you're admin, error if not.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Python Scripts Still Work**

Your Python scripts use **Firebase Admin SDK** with service account credentials, which bypass these security rules. This is correct and expected!

The rules only apply to:
- ‚úÖ Web app users (browser)
- ‚úÖ Mobile app users
- ‚ùå **NOT** server-side scripts with admin credentials

So your exhaustive testing scripts will continue to save models to Firebase without any issues.

---

## üîí **Security Checklist**

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] Rules deployed successfully (no errors in console)
- [ ] Non-admin users cannot modify their `role` field
- [ ] Non-admin users cannot modify their `subscription` field
- [ ] Users can still update their settings/favorites
- [ ] Python scripts can still save models to Firebase
- [ ] Authenticated users can read picks
- [ ] Only admins can create/update picks

---

## üìù **Next Steps**

Once rules are deployed:

1. ‚úÖ **Test the rules** (use the tests above)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify Python scripts still work** (check if models are still being saved)
3. ‚úÖ **Move to Task 2:** Domain Purchase

---

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes (including testing)  
**Status:** Ready to deploy!

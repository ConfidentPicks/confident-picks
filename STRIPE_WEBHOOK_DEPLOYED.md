**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED & READY

---

## üéâ What Was Deployed

### Firebase Cloud Functions Created:

1. **`stripeWebhook`** - Main webhook handler
   - **URL:** `https://us-central1-confident-picks-app-8-25.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook`
   - **Purpose:** Handles Stripe payment events
   - **Events:** checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted

2. **`testFunction`** - Test endpoint
   - **URL:** `https://us-central1-confident-picks-app-8-25.cloudfunctions.net/testFunction`
   - **Purpose:** Verify deployment is working

---

## üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Register Webhook in Stripe

You MUST register this webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard for payments to work.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Stripe Webhooks:**
   - Open: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - **Make sure you're in LIVE MODE** (toggle in top-right)

2. **Click "+ Add endpoint"**

3. **Enter Webhook Details:**
   ```
   Endpoint URL: https://us-central1-confident-picks-app-8-25.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook
   
   Description: Confident Picks - Subscription Management
   
   Version: Latest API version
   ```

4. **Select Events to Listen For:**
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.deleted`

5. **Click "Add endpoint"**

6. **Copy the Signing Secret:**
   - After creating, you'll see a "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_...`)
   - **Keep this secret!** You'll need it later for webhook verification

---

## üß™ Test the Webhook

### Test 1: Verify Deployment
```bash
curl https://us-central1-confident-picks-app-8-25.cloudfunctions.net/testFunction
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Confident Picks Cloud Functions are working!",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T..."
}
```

### Test 2: Send Test Event from Stripe

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click on your newly created endpoint
3. Click **"Send test webhook"**
4. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Click **"Send test webhook"**
6. Check the response - should see `200 OK`

### Test 3: Check Firebase Logs

```bash
firebase functions:log --only stripeWebhook --project confident-picks-app-8-25
```

You should see log entries like:
```
üì® Webhook event received: { type: 'checkout.session.completed', ... }
```

## üìä How It Works

### Payment Flow:

1. **User clicks "Upgrade"** on confident-picks.com
2. **Redirected to Stripe Checkout** (secure payment page)
3. **User enters payment details** and completes purchase
4. **Stripe processes payment** and charges card
5. **Stripe sends webhook** to your Cloud Function
6. **Cloud Function receives event** and updates Firestore
7. **User subscription activated** in database
8. **User redirected back** to confident-picks.com
9. **User sees premium picks** on next page load

### What the Webhook Does:

```javascript
// When payment completes:
checkout.session.completed ‚Üí Activate premium subscription

// When subscription renews/updates:
customer.subscription.updated ‚Üí Update subscription details

// When user cancels:
customer.subscription.deleted ‚Üí Downgrade to free tier
```

## üîí Security Features

### ‚úÖ What's Secure:
- Function runs on Google Cloud (secure infrastructure)
- Only accepts POST requests
- Logs all events for debugging
- Updates Firestore with atomic operations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Missing (Optional Enhancement):
- **Webhook signature verification** - Prevents spoofed requests
- To add this, you'd need to:
  1. Store the signing secret in Firebase config
  2. Use Stripe SDK to verify signatures
  3. Reject invalid signatures

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate (Required):
- [ ] Register webhook in Stripe Dashboard (instructions above)
- [ ] Test webhook with Stripe test event
- [ ] Create live mode price in Stripe
- [ ] Update `index.html` with live price ID

### Soon (Recommended):
- [ ] Add webhook signature verification
- [ ] Set up email notifications for successful payments
- [ ] Add error monitoring (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Test full payment flow end-to-end

### Later (Optional):
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed webhook processing
- [ ] Implement webhook event logging to Firestore
- [ ] Add admin dashboard to view webhook events
- [ ] Set up alerts for webhook failures

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving events:
1. Check Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks > Recent deliveries
2. Verify endpoint URL is correct
3. Check Firebase Functions logs for errors
4. Ensure Cloud Functions are deployed

### Subscription not activating:
1. Check Firebase logs: `firebase functions:log --only stripeWebhook`
2. Verify `client_reference_id` is being passed in checkout
3. Check Firestore for user document updates
4. Verify user ID matches Firebase Auth UID

### Function errors:
```bash
# View recent logs
firebase functions:log --only stripeWebhook --limit 50

# View logs in real-time
firebase functions:log --only stripeWebhook --follow
```

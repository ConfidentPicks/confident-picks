## ⚠️ Why No 2025 Sheet?

Google Sheets has a **10 million cell limit** per workbook. With 114 columns per player:
- 2021-2024 = ~8.6 million cells ✅
- Adding 2025 would exceed 10 million cells ❌

## ✅ Solution for 2025

**2025 data is already updating hourly in:**
- `upcoming_games` sheet
- `live_picks_sheets` sheet  
- Firebase `picks` collection

For detailed 2025 player stats, you can:
1. Query the current season's data separately
2. Use Firebase for 2025 live stats
3. Create a separate workbook for 2025 when needed

## 🎯 Perfect for Model Building!

### Use Cases:

**1. Player Performance Models:**
- Historical averages by opponent
- Week-over-week trends
- Home/away splits
- Weather impact analysis

**2. Prop Betting Models:**

- Over/under modeling
- Touchdown probability
- Yardage projections

**3. Matchup Analysis:**
- Player vs specific teams
- Position group performance
- QB-WR stack analysis
- Defense vs position analysis

**4. Trend Analysis:**

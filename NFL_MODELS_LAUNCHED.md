# 🏈 NFL Models Launched! 

## ✅ **WHAT WAS DONE**

Created and launched **2 new NFL exhaustive testing scripts** to find models with 70%+ accuracy for each of the 32 NFL teams:

### **1. NFL Spread Model (`nfl_spread_exhaustive_test.py`)**
- **Target:** 32 teams at 70%+ accuracy for spread cover predictions
- **Features:** Win percentage, point differential, recent form, streak, spread cover history, home field advantage (2.5 points)
- **Models Tested:** AdaBoost, RandomForest, GradientBoosting
- **Status:** ✅ **RUNNING** (PowerShell window minimized)
- **Progress File:** `nfl_spread_progress.json`
- **Firebase Collection:** `approved_models` (document ID: `NFL_{TEAM}_Spread`)

### **2. NFL Total Model (`nfl_total_exhaustive_test.py`)**
- **Target:** 32 teams at 70%+ accuracy for over/under predictions
- **Features:** Win percentage, points per game, points against per game, recent form, streak, over/under history, combined offensive/defensive metrics
- **Models Tested:** AdaBoost, RandomForest, GradientBoosting
- **Status:** ✅ **RUNNING** (PowerShell window minimized)
- **Progress File:** `nfl_total_progress.json`
- **Firebase Collection:** `approved_models` (document ID: `NFL_{TEAM}_Total`)

## 🔄 **WHAT'S CURRENTLY RUNNING**

You now have **6 exhaustive testing scripts** running simultaneously in the background:

| Script | Sport | Prop | Status | Progress |
|--------|-------|------|--------|----------|
| `nhl_exhaustive_test.py` | NHL | Moneyline | 🔄 Running | 8/32 teams (25%) |
| `nhl_puckline_exhaustive_test.py` | NHL | Puck Line | 🔄 Running | 17/32 teams (53%) |
| `nfl_spread_exhaustive_test.py` | NFL | Spread | 🔄 **NEW!** | 0/32 teams (starting...) |
| `nfl_total_exhaustive_test.py` | NFL | Total | 🔄 **NEW!** | 0/32 teams (starting...) |

---

## 📊 **DASHBOARD STATUS**

### **Current Display:**
- ✅ **NHL Moneyline:** Shows progress (12/32 teams)
- ✅ **NHL Puck Line:** Shows progress (17/32 teams)
- ❌ **NFL Spread:** Shows "Not started yet" (will update once JSON file is created)
- ❌ **NFL Total:** Shows "Not started yet" (will update once JSON file is created)

### **Why "Not Started Yet"?**
The dashboard reads from JSON progress files. The NFL scripts just started, so they haven't created their progress files yet. **Within 1-2 minutes**, you should see:
- `nfl_spread_progress.json` created
- `nfl_total_progress.json` created
- Dashboard will auto-refresh and show progress bars

## 🎯 **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

Based on NHL performance:
- **NHL Puck Line:** 17 teams found in ~3 hours → **53% complete** 🎉
- **NHL Moneyline:** 8 teams found in ~3 hours → **25% complete**
- **NFL Spread:** Just started → **0% complete**
- **NFL Total:** Just started → **0% complete**

**Estimated time to 70%+ teams:**
- NHL Puck Line: **2-4 more hours** (already at 53%)
- NHL Moneyline: **6-12 more hours**
- NFL Spread: **6-12 hours** (similar to NHL)
- NFL Total: **6-12 hours** (similar to NHL)

## 🔍 **HOW TO MONITOR**

### **Option 1: Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Open: `http://localhost:8000/model_performance_dashboard.html`
2. Watch the "Active Training Sessions" section
3. Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds

### **Option 2: Firebase Monitor**
```bash
python confident-picks-automation\monitor_firebase_models.py
```
Shows real-time count of models saved to Firebase.

### **Option 3: Check JSON Files Directly**
```bash
type nfl_spread_progress.json
type nfl_total_progress.json
```

### **Option 4: PowerShell Windows**
Look for the minimized PowerShell windows - they show live output as models are tested.

## 📈 **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT**

### **As Scripts Run:**
1. ✅ Scripts test thousands of model configurations
2. ✅ When a team reaches 70%+ accuracy, it's **immediately saved to Firebase**
3. ✅ Progress JSON files update every time a new best is found
4. ✅ Dashboard auto-refreshes to show new progress
5. ✅ Table shows new models as they're approved

### **When You Refresh Dashboard:**
You should see:
- **Progress bars** for NFL Spread and NFL Total (once JSON files are created)
- **NFL models in the table** (once teams reach 70%+)
- **Increasing team counts** (e.g., 1/32 → 2/32 → 3/32...)

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

Within the next **5-10 minutes**, you should see:

- [ ] `nfl_spread_progress.json` file created
- [ ] `nfl_total_progress.json` file created
- [ ] Dashboard shows "NFL Spread: 0/32 teams" (instead of "Not started yet")
- [ ] Dashboard shows "NFL Total: 0/32 teams" (instead of "Not started yet")
- [ ] PowerShell windows show "Loaded X games" and "Features created"

Within the next **1-2 hours**, you should see:

- [ ] First NFL Spread team reaches 70%+ and appears in Firebase
- [ ] First NFL Total team reaches 70%+ and appears in Firebase
- [ ] Dashboard table shows NFL models alongside NHL models
- [ ] Progress bars increase (e.g., 1/32, 2/32, 3/32...)

## 🎉 **SUMMARY**

### **Before:**
- ✅ NHL Moneyline: Running
- ✅ NHL Puck Line: Running

### **After:**
- ✅ NHL Moneyline: Running (8/32 teams)
- ✅ NHL Puck Line: Running (17/32 teams)
- ✅ **NFL Spread: Running (just started!)**
- ✅ **NFL Total: Running (just started!)**

### **Next Steps:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for NFL scripts to initialize
2. Refresh dashboard to see progress bars appear

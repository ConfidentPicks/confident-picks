# 🏈 NFL Betting Prediction Models - Complete Guide

## 🤖 What I Can Build vs DataRobot

### DataRobot Approach:
- ✅ Automated ML with minimal coding
- ✅ Built-in feature engineering
- ✅ Easy deployment
- ❌ Expensive enterprise solution
- ❌ Limited customization
- ❌ Black box models

### My Custom Approach:
- ✅ **Full control** over model architecture
- ✅ **Custom feature engineering** specific to NFL betting
- ✅ **Multiple model types** (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Ensemble)
- ✅ **Free and customizable**
- ✅ **Integration** with your existing data pipeline
- ✅ **Betting value calculations**
- ✅ **Real-time predictions** from Google Sheets

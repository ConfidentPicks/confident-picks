## 📞 Questions?

- **"How do I know it's working?"** - Check the JSON files, they update every time a better model is found
- **"Can I close the windows?"** - NO! Keep them open or the scripts stop
- **"What if my computer restarts?"** - Scripts will stop, but you can restart them and they'll continue testing
- **"How much longer?"** - Check `best_teams_at_70plus` in the JSON files
